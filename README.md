**Library-Management-System**

Here I used the **Tkinter** module used in python to build a GUI.

To test this project locally -
Create a database using mysql and then connect it to python code using pymysql.connector (wiritten in the main.py )
Make sure you change the mypass and mydatabase with your database and password.

Tada Your code works !!!
